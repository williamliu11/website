    <h1> 1.1.9 PLTW Flower Maker Game </h1>
     <p> We created an interactive flower maker for our 1.1.9 project. User is asked to input a style of flower, stem height, flower size, color, petal color, etc. The turtle draws the background, and draws a flower based on user input. Uses movement to move around and create, uses iteration to create multiple petals, and uses conditional execution with if statement multiple times.</p>

    <h1> 1.2.5 3 Player Draw Project</h1>
     <p> We created a 3 player drawing competition/game. Judge chooses a halloween themed object
	     for players to draw, and they have a certain amount of time to draw it using WASD and arrow keys.
	     The judge awards points to the better drawing, and after a certain amount of rounds, the judge can end 
	     the game, and the player with more points wins. List indexing is used to make each item only drawable 
	     once, turtle functions are used to draw the drawing. Strings are used within the timer.</p>

    <h1> Jetpack Joyride Scratch Project</h1>
	    <p>Created a Jetpack Joyride game using Scratch. Player presses space to go up, and you try to dodge zappers and missiles to escape the facility
	    Events, background changes, score, change in costume, animations, and more, were all used in the process of developing this game.</p>

    <h1> 2.1.6 Fish Tank Project</h1>
	    <p>We Identified the problems with the fish tank monitor by using the debug function and breakpoints. We then went inside the problems, which were the alkalinity, temperature, and magnesium monitors and corrected the problems, which involved list indexing, setting variables to the right numbers, and creating a valid range of numbers. </p>

    <h1> 4.1.4 Honeycomb Simulation Project</h1>
	    <p> We analyzed the honeycomb simulation on netlogo and discovered what the model simulated, what turtles represented, how randomness was used within code and what that did, and what patches represented. We then came up with real-world application problems, and came up with ideas to solve these problems. </p>
